Method Hijack for Delphi (Win32 and Win64)


Hi, Delphi community :)

LMBelo here. I'd like to share my Delphi Method Hijack. 
It consist in method injection, or method substitution.
You can change a target method to execute a new code from a new method, independently of its access modifiers.

See you.
